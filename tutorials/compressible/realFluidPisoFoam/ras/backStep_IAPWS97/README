This tutorial is to show how the IAPWSThermo work in foam 

//***********************INFORMATION TO TEST CASE*******************************//

Important files in this case:

1. thermophysicalProperties 

--> see thermotype

2. controlDict: 

the dynamic libraries used for the IAPWS 97 water properties are not directly link into foam.
Therefore, the dynamic libraries need to be defined in controlDict


//************************NEW CODE NEEDED FOR THIS CASE*************************//

1. Code in foam: $WM_PROJECT_DIR/src/thermophysicalModels/externalMedia/
   just run wmake libso in the folder

2. FreeSteam: download the code @ http://freesteam.sourceforge.net/example.php

//***********************Problems*******************************//

If problems occur using the IAPWS 97 water properties, please check the following points

1. have you successfully compiled freeSteam? 

      a: If no, have you installed gsl, scons and so on (see README.txt in the freeSteam)
      b: If yes, is the libfreesteam.so in a folder where foam finds it e.g. $WM_PROJECT_DIR/lib/...

2. have you compiled the thermophysical models that connect freeSteam to foam. They can be found in this folder: $WM_PROJECT_DIR/src/
     thermophysicalModels/externalMedia/


3. IS THE SOLVER STARTING TO RUN THE CASE? NO
 
   check b23.c file at line 39 (or at least somewhere in the code:

   if you find the following code:
       return B23_N[4] + sqrt((pi - B23_N[5])/B23_N[3]) /* * 1{K} */;

   change it to this:
       return B23_N[4] + sqrt(fabs(pi - B23_N[5])/B23_N[3]) /* * 1{K} */;
