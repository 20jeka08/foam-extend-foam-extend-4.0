Solid Mechanics
Finite Volume Solvers

The included solid mechanics solvers employ the finite volume method
(not finite elements/elephants) to numerically approximate the
displacements and stresses in solid bodies undergoing deformation.

The included solvers feature the following capabilities:
    small strain
    small strain with large rotations
    large strain
    Mises-Levy J2 plasticity
    thermal-elasticity
    visco-elasticity
    gravity body forces
    fluid-structure interactions
    multi-material analyses
    contact stress analysis with friction
    small strain orthotropic elasticity
    large strain orthotropic elasticity
    cohesive zones
    	predefined crack path
        arbitrary crack propagation
    custom boundary conditions
    
A number of people have contributed to the development of the solvers,
mainly within Alojz Ivankovic's research group. The code has been
assembled and is maintained by Philip Cardiff (University College Dublin),
and significant contributions have been made by Aleksandar Karac, Zeljko
Tukovic, Hrvoje Jasak, Declan Carolan, Michael Leonard and Valentine
Kanyanta.

Have fun.
